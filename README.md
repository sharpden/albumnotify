# albumnotify

It could be painful to check Wikipedia for any new music album of 100+ artists. This script uses http://musicbrainz.org/ JSON API in order to get a list of albums by list of artists you like.

Put in `bands.txt` (sample included) list of your favorite bands or musicians and run script. If musicbrainz fails to determine relevant musician (rarely enough), add comment with musicbrainz id. Script generates HTML report (sample included) and opens in browser.
